**Healthcare Analytics Project – Improving Efficiency in Total Hip Replacement Care**

---

## 📌 Project Overview  
Healthcare providers face the dual challenge of **improving patient outcomes** while **managing costs effectively**.  
This project analyzes **Hospital Inpatient Discharge Data (Total Hip Replacement)** to uncover insights on:  
- Patient demographics  
- Hospital performance  
- Length of stay  
- Cost vs. charges  
- Efficiency and resource utilization  

The ultimate goal is to help healthcare organizations identify **efficiency gaps** and improve the quality of care.  

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement  
Hospitals often struggle to balance **high-quality patient care** with **cost efficiency**.  
Using real inpatient discharge data, this project aims to:  
1. Detect inefficiencies in hospital operations.  
2. Benchmark hospitals on cost, length of stay, and outcomes.  
3. Build data-driven features (e.g., efficiency index) for advanced analysis.

## 📂 Dataset  
- **Source**: Hospital Inpatient Discharges (Total Hip Replacement)  
- **Rows**: 26,594  
- **Columns**: 30  
- **Includes**: Patient demographics, hospital info, diagnosis/procedure codes, costs, and outcomes.

## 🛠️ Project Workflow  

### 1. Data Preprocessing  
- Handle missing values  
- Standardize categorical fields  
- Detect and treat outliers  
- Engineer new features (charge-to-cost ratio, efficiency index)  

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Patient demographics trends  
- Hospital efficiency comparisons  
- Cost vs. outcome visualizations  

### 3. Predictive Modeling (Future Scope)  
- Length of stay prediction  
- Cost prediction  
- Risk stratification  

### 4. Dashboard (Future Scope)  
- Interactive hospital benchmarking dashboard  
- KPIs: Efficiency index, avg. LOS, cost-to-charge ratios
